This is my personal website. I'm attempting to capture the essence of what I have learned during a 20 year career in construction. 

I have discovered an interest in the software that is being used, how it is being used, and how it is helping or quite often making things challenging for the Project Manager and his team. 

I'm keen on defining the "what is lacking" in the software and processes we use these days AND give it a good crack to see if I might be able to improve.

I find that

-software looks dated and not intersting
-is not very much fun to use, lacks the "cool" factor
-ultimately comes short of giving the user "superpowers", by empowering them with useful and helpful insights

Critical things it should do:
-help with knowing where you are at precisely (live no lag time)
-give you the info you need, so that you have the answers to the questions that are going to be asked by the Owners and internal managers
